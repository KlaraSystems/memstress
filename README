memstress

A small tool for testing route creation policies against a memory limit

usage: memstress [Hhmnrvwxyz]
       memstress: apply memory pressure either through
       memory allocations or route creation
       -H       display a route creation time histogram
       -h       print help (this message)
       -m       perform memory allocation test
       -n       allocation size in pages for memory tests
                (default: vm.stats.vm.page_count)
       -r       perform route addition tests
       -v       veto size in pages (default: vm.v_free_target)
                Size in pages that would veto an allocation/route addition
       -w       wait between allocation/addition before freeing
       -x       number of addresses in x part of subnet
       -y       number of addresses in y part of subnet
       -z       number of addresses in z part of subnet

       Route addition tests will add routes from 10.z.y.x addresses via 1.0.0.1
       this needs to be configured on an interface or the test will fail immediately
